# PA-4
Python Version: 
For starters: import seaborn, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot for the following problems
```
import pandas as pd

import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
# 1) Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
> Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas
> a) Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
> b) Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female

- In this problem, it is supposed to return only certain data in the data frame along with the given conditions
- I then tried using conditional statements using conditional operators such as '&' and '==' and '>' to set conditions and meet the required data
- For the second part of this problem, I used the same process as I did with the first part but this time I had a hard time trying to analyze how to get the average 


# 2) Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?
